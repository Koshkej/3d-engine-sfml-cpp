An implementation of a primitive 3D engine in C++ that renders graphics using the SFML library 🎮✨

****Features and TODO:**** 
  - Basic 3D object transformations and camera controls.
  - Simple shading and rendering of primitives.
  - Demonstrates the integration of SFML for window management, rendering, and handling user input.

_A hands-on project to learn 3D graphics programming and the use of SFML in C++._
